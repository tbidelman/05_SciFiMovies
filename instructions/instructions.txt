Sci-Fi Movies (or Even More Links and Images)!


This project folder contains a blank index.html page and a selection of images of
sci-fi movie posters.  Your task is to build out index.html with information about 
the sci-fi genre, and create a new featured.html page with a selection of the movie
posters, as well as some general information about movie posters.  Use the html
pages pictured in index.png and featured.png as reference.

Make sure to include the following concepts in your solution:
 - navigation bar to move between links
 - ordered and unordered lists
 - internal relative URLs
 - correctly sized and formatted images

Use http://picresize.com/ to resize, compress and save each image in the most appropriate format.
 - Top image should be 1050px x 364px
 - Thumbnail images should be 175px x 265px


HINTS
 - Organize your images within your HTML folder in a logical way that will make them easy to work with 
 - You don't have to retype all the text on the two pages - feel free to copy and paste from the source texts

BONUS
 - Find a couple of sci-fi themed SVG's here: http://www.flaticon.com/
 - Then, replace your nav bar text links with an <img> linking to an SVG. Instead of displaying the link text on the page, have it display at the tooltip on hover.
 - Check out this article about SVG's if you need more info about how to use them: https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/
	 - There's A LOT of information in there - much of which will go over your head
	 - That's OK! Coming across these sorts of things as you're teaching yourself how to code is common!
	 - Skip over stuff you don't understand and figure out the easiest way to use an SVG for this particular situation (it's easier than you might think)
 - There is a small space between the thumbnail images - can you figure out how to remove that space?
